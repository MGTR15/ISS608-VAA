# 1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics: ggplot2 methods

# Getting Started

## Install and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data,
       aes(x = RACE)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## 1.3 Introducing ggplot

![](images/image1.jpg) is an R package for **declaratively** creating **data-driven** graphics based on ***The Grammar of Graphics***

It is also part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.

# 1.3.1 R Graphics VS ggplot

First, let us compare how R Graphics, the core graphical functions of Base R and ggplot plot a simple histogram.

## R Graphics

```{r}
hist(exam_data$MATHS)
```

## ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

As you can see that the code chunk is relatively simple if R Graphics is used. Then, the question is why ggplot2 is recommended?
