# 1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics: ggplot2 methods

# Getting Started

## Install and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data,
       aes(x = RACE)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## 1.3 Introducing ggplot

![](images/image1.jpg) is an R package for **declaratively** creating **data-driven** graphics based on ***The Grammar of Graphics***

It is also part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.

# 1.3.1 R Graphics VS ggplot

First, let us compare how R Graphics, the core graphical functions of Base R and ggplot plot a simple histogram.

::: panel-tabset
## R Graphics

```{r}
hist(exam_data$MATHS)
```

## ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```
:::

As you can see that the code chunk is relatively simple if R Graphics is used. Then, the question is why ggplot2 is recommended?

As pointed out by Hadley Wickham

::: callout-note
## Important

The transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.

# 1.4 Grammer of Graphics

Before we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.

Grammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) **Grammar of Graphics**, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:

#### What is a statistical graphic?

In the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.

There are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:

-   Graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements

-   Meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping

A good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.

### 1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics

ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.

A short description of each building block are as follows:

-   **Data**: The dataset being plotted.

-   **Aesthetics** take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.

-   **Geometrics**: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.

-   **Facets** split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).

-   **Statistics**, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).

-   **Coordinate systems** define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.

-   **Themes** modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.
